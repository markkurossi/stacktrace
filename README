			      Stacktrace
			      ----------

The stacktrace program maps program counter values into corresponding
source files lines.  The program implements both interactive memory
leak check shell and a batch-mode leak dump annotator.  Stacktrace
uses the GNU Binary File Descriptor Library.  You have to have it
installed on your machine before you can compile this program.
Normally the library is installed but the header file is missing.  The
needed components are:

	bfd.h
	ansidecl.h
	libbfd.{so,a}

You can find the header files `bfd.h' and `ansidecl.h' from the
`include' sub-directory.  These are for NetBSD/x386 platform and might
not work on different platforms.

The file `stacktrace.el' contains an Emacs GUD (Grand Unified
Debugger) back-end for the stacktrace program.  You can enable Emacs'
stacktrace integration by copying the `stacktrace.el' into a directory
that is in the Emacs' `load-path' and by adding the following line
into your `.emacs' file:

	(load "stacktrace" t t)

After this, you can used stacktrace from your Emacs as easily as you
can use gdb:

    M-x stacktrace<Return>PROGRAM stacktrace.log<Return>
